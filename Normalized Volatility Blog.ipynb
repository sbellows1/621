    "An interesting idea is to standardize the returns of financial markets by both the recent returns and recent volatility. Standardizing by recent returns will return lower values in strong uptrends and higher values in strong downtrends. Standardizing by recent volatility will return lower values in volatile markets and higher values in low volatility markets.\n",
    "We see the results of a simple test below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very possible to data mine around this by optimizing across the period parameter of the standardization as well as the holding period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardizing by volatility is very interesting as it gives perspective on how large a market move is in terms of recent ranges of the market. This can be useful in putting market data in perspective of the recent market structure."
